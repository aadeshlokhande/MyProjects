# Find Missing Number using Python

# explanation
# Finding a missing number in a list involves identifying the absent numbers within a specified range. Typically, the problem is framed as follows:
# Given a list with numbers ranging from 0 to n, where one number is missing, find the missing number in the list.
# To solve this, iterate through the list, store the numbers not found, and determine the missing number. Here's how you can achieve this using Python.

# code 
def findMissingNumbers(n):
    numbers = set(n)
    length = len(n)
    output = []
    for i in range(1, n[-1]):
        if i not in numbers:
            output.append(i)
    return output
    
listOfNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16]
print(findMissingNumbers(listOfNumbers))

# Output: [4, 12, 15]
